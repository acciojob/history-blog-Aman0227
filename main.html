<h1>History</h1>

<p>
    <b>Main articles:</b> History of blogging and online diary. An early example of a "diary" style blog consisted of text and images transmitted wirelessly in real-time from a wearable computer on February 22, 1995. The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on December 17, 1997, and “blog” was later popularized when Peter Merholz shortened it to “we blog”.
